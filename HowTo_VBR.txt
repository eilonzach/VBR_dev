HOW TO setup prior models for some seismic measurement, using the VBR
In general, the process is as follows: 
(1) run a forward model to predict a spatial distribution of thermodynamic state variables (pressure, temperature, grain size, melt fraction, etc.. ), i.e. 
(a) a 1D cooling model, 
(b) a thermomechanical calculation (viscoelastic model with heat production and advection)
(c) prior models that are not calculated from first principles.

(2) calculate all the mechanical properties across the viscoelastic spectrum, using the VBR calculator (not on github yet). 

(3) Compare the result to an observation, such as a Vs profile from inversion of surface wave measurements, or do a forward model of a process (ie GIA or anelastic wave propagation) that leads to a measurement (such as t* for attenuation or GPS velocities for GIA). 


=================================
1. Setup the array of prior models (make a Box)

1a. Run the cooling model: 
In 2_PLATES/1_1D_cooling, setup your resolution, potential temp, all other initial parameters in "DRIVE_cooling.m". This outputs the "Box" data structure that contains a "Movie" with the results of each forward model. Give yours a unique name. 

1b. Add the steps: 
cd ../Make_StepPMs

To vary amplitude and depth of the step (Expt 1 in B+H, 2014), 
open DRIVE_addTstep_dTdepth.m. 

To vary amplitude and sharpness (gradient) of the step, at one depth (Expt 2),
open DRIVE_addTstep_sharpness.m. 


	
=================================
2.  run the VBR on the prior models (add VBR calculations to PMbox)
Send it to orestes 2_/5_/3_ and fix DRIVE_WaveFD

=================================
3.  run the VBR on the prior models (make PMseismo)
