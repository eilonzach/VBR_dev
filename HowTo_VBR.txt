HOW TO setup prior models for some seismic measurement, using the VBR



=================================
1. Setup the array of prior models (make PMbox)

1a. Run the cooling model: 
In 2_PLATES/1_1D_cooling, setup your resolution, potential temp, all other initial parameters in "DRIVE_cooling.m". This outputs the "Movie" data structure. Give yours a unique name. 

1b. Add the steps: 
cd ../Make_StepPMs

To vary amplitude and depth of the step (Expt 1 in B+H, 2014), 
open DRIVE_addTstep_dTdepth.m. 

To vary amplitude and sharpness (gradient) of the step, at one depth (Expt 2),
open DRIVE_addTstep_sharpness.m. 


	
=================================
2.  run the VBR on the prior models (add VBR calculations to PMbox)
Send it to orestes 2_/5_/3_ and fix DRIVE_WaveFD

=================================
3.  run the VBR on the prior models (make PMseismo)
